# PRODIGY_WD_03

This project involves the development of a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed as a responsive web application. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides a simple yet interactive experience. It features user interaction to place markers, robust game state management, and functions to check for all winning conditions. The application supports a local two-player mode. The primary goal is to create an engaging, mobile-friendly game with a clean and well-structured codebase.
